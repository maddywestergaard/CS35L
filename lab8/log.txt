First, I set up the beaglebone as outlined in the Piazza post.

My partner was the client and I acted as the server.
The steps I took as the server were as follows:

To create a public key:

$ ssh-keygen

Then to add a new user and set the password:
$ sudo useradd -d /home/newuser -m maddy
$ sudo passwd maddy

Then to make the .ssh directory
$ cd /home/newuser
$ sudo mkdir .ssh
$ sudo chown -R maddy .ssh
$ sudo chmod 700 .ssh

Now that the server side is done and the account is created,
my partner copied the id, added the account, and was able to log into
my server.

First I ran ifconfig on my computer to get the ip address.

$ ssh-copy-id -i maddy@10.97.85.190
$ ssh-add
$ ssh -X maddy@10.97.85.190

Then she entered in the password that I had set on my computer 
and was able to log into my server.

Then she ran 
$ xterm

and the xterm terminal popped up.
