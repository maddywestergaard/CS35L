Q1: The patch makes the performance worse, since now whenever
ls -aA is called it has to go through the separate function 
to run it. It makes the usability better, however.

Q2: Using the patch may introduce other problems with the
application if in anywhere in the application ls -aA is 
called. In that case, the redefined behavior for ls would have
to be accounted for and adjusted.

Q3: This is what inputs when /dev/null is passed as an argument

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "randline.py", line 70, in <module>
    main()
  File "randline.py", line 64, in main
    sys.stdout.write(generator.chooseline())
  File "randline.py", line 34, in chooseline
    return random.choice(self.lines)
  File "/usr/local/cs/Python-2.7.14/lib/python2.7/random.py", line 277, 
in choice
    return seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))]  
    # raises IndexError if seq is empty
IndexError: list index out of range

This happens because the program trys to read a line from an empty file, 
which results in undefined behavior

Q4: Running on Python 3 gives this error:

  File "randline.py", line 65
    except IOError as (errno, strerror):
                      ^

SyntaxError: invalid syntax

Python3 does not support automatic tuple unpacking like python2 does, 
so then it throws a syntax error.
