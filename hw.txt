HW QUESTIONS

1. The network would still be secure even if the other teams had been
observing all the bytes going across the network. This is because they
would only have access to the encrypted version, and would need the private 
keys to decrypt it and get the information.
    (1) if they tapped the keyboards, they would know the passphrases but it
    	wouldnt make a difference because they would still need the keys
	to decrypt the bytes.
    (2) If the teams had physical control of the USB, then we would be in 
    	trouble since they could then have access to the .ssh file and get
	the keys to decrypt the bytes.

2. The gpg2 --verify command doesnt really verify that you personally created
the file because it only verifies that the public key matches the signature.
You can fix this by using a company or other third party that tracks who posts
the key and who generated it. This would be another step to verify that the 
person trying to access the information is allowed to.
