1. 
$ emacs hw9.txt

2. check out v3.0 of diffutils from repo 
$ cd diffutils
add branch quote:
$ git checkout -b 'quote' 'v3.0'

3. apply patch
$ patch -p1 < quote-3.0-patch.txt

5. 
For each file that was changed, go into the file using emacs
and then do C-x 4 a and add the component from the other ChangeLog
that matches that file:

* src/util.c (finish_output):

* src/sdiff.c (try_help, usage, check_child_status, main):

* src/dir.c (compare_names):

* src/diff3.c (main, try_help, option_help_msgid, usage)
            (read_diff):

* src/diff.c (main, try_help, option_help_msgid, specify_value)
            (compare_files):
        
* src/cmp.c (try_help, specify_ignore_initial, usage, main):
        Quote 'like this' in output.

6. commit the changes
$ git add .
$ git commit -F ChangeLog

7. to get the formatted patch
$ git format-patch --stdout -1 > formatted-patch.txt

8. verifying partners:
first make a new branch within diffutils

$ git checkout -b 'partner' 'v3.0'

Then I downloaded his patch and applied it

$ git am < formatted-patch.txt

The patch succeeded, so i build the system

$ ./bootstrap
$ configure
$ make
$ make check

and it worked!

9. verifying the ChangeLog:
go back to my branch and run the command:

$ make distdir

then find the new diffutils folder it made:

$ cd diffutils-3.0.1-43fe

Then enter into the ChangeLog:

$ emacs ChangeLog

It worked, my change log entry was at the top of the list with my commit!
