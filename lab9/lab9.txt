1. getting a copy of the Diffutils repository:
$ git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/diffutils.git

2. get a log of the changes:
$ cd diffutils
$ git log > git-log.txt

3. generating a list of tags:
$ git tag > git-tags.txt

4. to find the commit titled “maint: quote 'like this' or "like this", not `like this'”
I searched through the git-log.txt

$ emacs git-log.txt
$ C-s maint: quote 'like this' or "like this", not `like this'

Found the commit that matched and copied the commit number:

commit 62ca21c8c1a5aa3488589dcb191a4ef04ae9ed4f
Author: Paul Eggert <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>
Date:   Wed Jan 25 23:46:16 2012 -0800

    maint: quote 'like this' or "like this", not `like this'

Then showed it and saved the quote patch to quote-patch.txt
$ git show 62ca21c8c1a5aa3488589dcb191a4ef04ae9ed4f > quote-patch.txt

5. checked out version 3.0 from repo
$ git checkout v3.0

6. Then to apply the patch
$ patch -p1 < quote-patch.txt

had to skip past some that it wouldnt find

Here are all the errors:
can't find file to patch at input line 35

To revert the changes to the files other than .c files, for each one I did:
$ emacs NEWS
C-x v = 
C-x v u

Then for the .c files i found
from the gnu.org website -
C-c C-a
Apply this hunk to its target file (diff-apply-hunk). With a prefix argument 
of C-u, revert this hunk. 

So I did this for every hunk in each .c file that made a change to something 
other than a character string constant:
C-u C-c C-a

10.
Then I looked to all the src/*.c.rej files that I had, which were 
src/diff.c and src/diff3.c and applied the changes manually to each file.

11.
$ git status

# Untracked files:

#	src/system.h.orig

To remove all untracked files:
$ git clean -f

12.
$ git status
# HEAD detached at v3.0
# Changes not staged for commit:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
#   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
#
#	modified:   src/cmp.c
#	modified:   src/diff.c
#	modified:   src/diff3.c
#	modified:   src/dir.c
#	modified:   src/sdiff.c
#	modified:   src/util.c

Then to get quote-3.0-patch.txt,

$ git diff > quote-3.0-patch.txt

13.
In file README-HACKING:
$ ./bootstrap

Then to apply the additional patch since i was on lnxsrv09
$ wget http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/fall18/cs35L/assign/diffutils-gets.diff
$ patch -p0 < diffutils-gets.diff

$ ./configure
$ make
$ make check

Then running “diff . -” and “diff --help”, we can see that the quotes are the
right way, so the patch worked.

14.
For the sanity test:
$ git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/diffutils.git diffutils-3.0
$ cd diffutils-3.0
$ git checkout 'v3.0'
$ cd -
$ mkdir diffutils-3.0-patch
$ cp ./diffutils/src/*.c ./diffutils-3.0-patch/

Now to compare patched version to original
$ ./diffutils/src/diff -pru diffutils-3.0/src diffutils-3.0-patch > quote-3.0-test.txt

15.
Then I ran this:
$ diff -u quote-3.0-test.txt quote-3.0-patch.txt

and the only differences were from the ' ` that were reversed
